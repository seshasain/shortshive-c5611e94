Close up on Buddy's paws unearthing something papery from the soil. The camera focuses on a rolled-up, aged-looking scroll tied with twine as Buddy proudly presents it, tail wagging.
Dialogue/Narration: It started like any other afternoon, until Buddy started digging... and digging...

SCENE 2:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Leo carefully unrolls the scroll on a wooden picnic table. It's a hand-drawn map on aged parchment, marked with 'X' and cryptic symbols. Max leans in close, eyes wide with wonder. Buddy sits beside them, panting excitedly, nudging the map with his nose.
Dialogue/Narration: ...but this wasn't just any hole he was making. He'd found something incredible!

SCENE 3:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Close-up on the map details - winding lines representing paths, a cartoonish tree, and the big red 'X'. Leo points at the 'X' with his finger, tracing the lines. Max mimics him, his little hand following Leo's. Buddy barks softly, as if understanding the importance.
Dialogue/Narration: A real treasure map! Leading to... adventure!

SCENE 4:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Transition to the boys and Buddy venturing into the 'wilds' of their backyard - overgrown bushes and trees forming a mini-forest. Leo, holding the map like a compass, leads the way. Max follows closely behind, tripping slightly on uneven ground but quickly recovering with a giggle. Buddy bounds ahead, sniffing the ground.
Dialogue/Narration: Armed with their map, Leo and Max, with their trusty first mate Buddy, set off.

SCENE 5:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: They navigate past a towering oak tree, marked on the map as a landmark. Leo checks the map against the real tree, nodding confidently. Max peers up at the massive tree trunk in awe. Buddy playfully circles the base of the tree, tail wagging.
Dialogue/Narration: The map was surprisingly accurate. First landmark, check!

SCENE 6:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: The scene shifts to a 'treacherous' stream â€“ a garden hose left running creates a small puddle with trickling water. Max hesitates at the 'stream'. Leo helps Max carefully step over the puddle, offering a hand. Buddy splashes right through, unfazed, shaking water droplets everywhere.
Dialogue/Narration: Next, a perilous river crossing! Or... a leaky hose.

SCENE 7:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: They reach the 'X' marked on the map, beneath a small, unassuming rose bush. Leo consults the map one last time, then nods decisively. Max grabs a small toy shovel from his backpack, his face beaming with anticipation.
Dialogue/Narration: According to the map, 'X' marked the spot. Time to dig!

SCENE 8:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Max digs enthusiastically at the base of the rose bush, kicking up loose soil. Leo helps him, using his hands to clear away dirt. Buddy watches intently, occasionally digging with his front paws, adding to the flurry of soil. 
Dialogue/Narration: The anticipation was building. What riches awaited them?

SCENE 9:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Max's shovel hits something solid with a 'thunk'.  He and Leo exchange excited glances. They carefully clear away more soil, revealing a small, wooden chest, slightly weathered but intact. 
Dialogue/Narration: And then... they found it! Buried treasure!

SCENE 10:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Leo and Max struggle to open the chest, finally succeeding with a creak.  Inside, instead of gold, are colorful, polished rocks and a handwritten note. Close-up on the note which reads: 'Congratulations Buccaneers! Treasure is adventure and friendship!'
Dialogue/Narration: But inside... not gold.  Something even better.

SCENE 11:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Leo reads the note aloud to Max, who is initially surprised, then breaks into a wide smile, picking up a shiny blue rock. Leo smiles too, understanding dawning on his face. Buddy licks Max's face happily. They examine the rocks, their 'treasure', under the sunlight.
Dialogue/Narration: The real treasure wasn't gold or jewels, but the adventure they had together. 

SCENE 12:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: The final scene shows Leo, Max, and Buddy walking back towards the house, silhouetted against the golden light of late afternoon. Max clutches a few colorful rocks in his hand. Leo pats Buddy on the head. They are laughing, their voices fading slightly as the scene slowly fades to black.
Dialogue/Narration: And that's the best treasure of all.
