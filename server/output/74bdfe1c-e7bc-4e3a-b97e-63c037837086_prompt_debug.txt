CHARACTER: Kevin
Description: A tall, slender minion with two eyes, also in blue overalls. Kevin is slightly more responsible than Bob, but still prone to silliness. He has a tuft of hair on his head and a mischievous grin, often trying to be the leader but easily swayed by Bob's enthusiasm.

SCENES:
SCENE 1:

Dialogue/Narration: When the clock strikes noon, you know what time it is... Banana Break!

SCENE 2:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Bob and Kevin DASH to a break room. Kevin dramatically slides on the floor, nearly tripping over a stack of boxes labeled 'DO NOT EAT'. Bob giggles and jumps over them. The break room is brightly lit and stocked with bananas.
Dialogue/Narration: Time to refuel with our favorite yellow treat!

SCENE 3:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Bob starts peeling a banana with gusto, while Kevin attempts a fancy peel, throwing the peel in the air and trying to catch it in a bin. He misses hilariously, the peel landing on Bob's head. Bob looks up, confused, with the peel on his single strand of hair.
Dialogue/Narration: Peeling a banana? Easy peasy... banana squeezy!

SCENE 4:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Kevin laughs as Bob removes the peel and playfully throws a piece back at Kevin, who ducks dramatically. A mini banana peel fight ensues, with peels flying everywhere in slow motion, sticking to the walls and ceiling.
Dialogue/Narration: Oops! Maybe a little too much fun?

SCENE 5:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: Suddenly, the door swings open and another, much larger minion, DAVE, enters, covered in banana peels from head to toe, looking bewildered and slipping on the peels covering the floor. Bob and Kevin freeze, bananas halfway to their mouths, wide-eyed.
Dialogue/Narration: Uh oh... looks like we made a bit of a mess.

SCENE 6:
Duration: 10 seconds
Visual Description: CLOSE UP on Bob and Kevin exchanging sheepish glances, then bursting into laughter. They offer Dave a fresh banana, which he hesitantly takes, a small smile forming on his peel-covered face. FADE OUT as banana peels continue to rain down comedically.
Dialogue/Narration: Banana break might be a little messy, but it's always better together!
